# test-blissim

To begin, don't forget to do another `npm install` and go for `npm run dev` to run the project.

I did the First Part, 1, and it was interesting to see how you're working at Blissim. I was used to utilize Typescript, Scss and Custom Hooks so I learned how to do without it.

And for the Second Part, I got helped by the material design v4 to go faster even if I am more pixel perfect in my usual journey.

I hope you are gonna enjoy the test as I enjoyed doing it.

Thanks and have a nice day :)
